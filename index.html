 <h2>What the?</h2>

<p>OKWS is the Web server that
powers <a href="http://www.okcupid.com">OkCupid.com</a>, specialized
for building fast and secure Web services. It provides Web developers
with a small set of tools that has proved powerful enough to build
complex systems with limited effort. Despite its emphasis on security,
OKWS shows performance advantages relative to popular
competitors. Commercial experience with OKWS suggests that the system
can reduce hardware and system management costs, while providing
security guarantees absent in current systems.
</p>

<p>
As of Dec 2011, OKWS is still being maintained and worked on, with
3.1 being the active development version.  There are no big
feature-development plans on the horizon, but we're regularly
committing bugfixes and extensions.
</p>


 <h2>Software Packages</h2>
 The main OKWS software package also depends upon the sfslite programming libraries
 for C++.  They are currently released separately, though in the future might be 
 bundled together for ease of installation.

 <h2>News</h2>

 <h3>12 Dec 2011</h3>
 <p>We are back up!</p>

 <p>We've moved off of our old dokuwiki, self-hosted machine, and onto a
 fully github-based hosting system. We're slowing porting wiki entries over.
 Most of the OKWS wiki entries should be ported, but there's work left
 to be done on sfslite and tame documentation.</p>
